## Installation

```
npm install -D @tailor-platform/dev-cli
```

Once after your installation, `tailordev` command will be available.

```
$ npx tailordev --help
Usage: tailordev [options] [command]

CLI for Tailor Platform application devs

Options:
  -V, --version                output the version number
  -h, --help                   display help for command

Commands:
  reset [options]              reset local environment
  start [options]              start local development environment
  apply [options]              apply manifest onto local environment
  import [options] <paths...>  import seed manifest (this needs minitailor running by `start` command)
  install:deps [options]       install required dependencies (tailorctl, cuelang)
  uninstall:deps               uninstall dependencies
  help [command]               display help for command
```

## Usage

`tailordev` CLI expects the following directory structure for example:

```
yourapp
├── pacakge.json
├── .tailordevenv.json
└── manifest
    └── config
        └── template
            ├── gateway.cue
            ├── pipelines.cue
            ├── stateflow.cue
            └── tailordb.cue
```

In this case you will need to have `.tailordevenv.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "stock-api",
  "manifest": "manifest/config/template",
  "target": ["gateway.cue", "pipelines.cue", "tailordb.cue", "stateflow.cue"]
}
```

This is the initial point to start out.

### 1. Install dependencies

Run `npx tailordev install:deps` will install required binaries on your local. Those will be placed under `~/.local/share/tailordev`.

It is recommended to run this command as `postinstall` in your package.json. You can remove those downloaded files by `npx tailordev uninstall:deps`.

### 2. Spin up local environment

Run `npx tailordev start` to start your local development envrionment. This needs docker-compose currently, so make sure it is installed and up on your machine.

`start` command generates `.tailordev` directory which has files generated by tailordev CLI. Those files will be generated every time in starting so can be ignored from your VCS.

### 3. Apply your manifest

Run `npx tailordev apply` to apply your application manifest onto your local dev environment next.

This also runs Cuelang evaluation (same as `cue eval`), and the evaluated files will be generated in `.tailordev/generated` with the same directory structure as the one you specified in `manifest` field in `.tailordevrc.json`.

`apply` command supports `--env <value>` option to switch your manifest in evaluation. This internally works as [attributes in Cuelang](https://cuetorials.com/deep-dives/attributes/#cues-attributes), so you will be able to switch values in manifest files with `@if(<value>)`.

## Use as npm scripts

As tailordev CLI is built with Node.js, it will be good fit to have it in your package.json scripts as well as other tools like Next.js.

```json
{
  "name": "yourapp",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "start:backend": "tailordev start",
    "apply": "tailordev apply",
    "reset": "tailordev reset",
    "postinstall": "tailordev install:deps"
  }
}
```
